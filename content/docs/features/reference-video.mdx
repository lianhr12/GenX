## Create with Consistency

Reference Video allows you to use an existing video as a style guide, ensuring consistent aesthetics across your content.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Reference** - Add a video that represents your desired style
2. **Provide Source Content** - Add images or text for the new video
3. **Adjust Influence** - Set how strongly the reference affects output
4. **Generate** - AI creates styled content
5. **Download** - Get your consistent video

## What Reference Video Captures

The AI analyzes your reference to understand:

- **Visual Style** - Colors, lighting, contrast
- **Motion Patterns** - Movement speed, flow, rhythm
- **Composition** - Framing, focus areas
- **Aesthetic Feel** - Overall mood and atmosphere

## Input Methods

### Reference + Images

Upload a reference video along with 1-10 images. The images will be transformed to match the reference style.

**Best for:**
- Brand-consistent product videos
- Style transfer to new content
- Visual series creation

### Reference + Text

Upload a reference video and provide a text prompt. New content will be generated matching the reference aesthetic.

**Best for:**
- Expanding existing visual themes
- Creating variations on a style
- Building cohesive content libraries

## Input Requirements

### Reference Video

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Formats | MP4, MOV, WebM |
| Max file size | 100MB |
| Duration | 2-60 seconds |
| Resolution | 480p - 4K |

### Source Images (if used)

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|

## Style Influence Settings

Control how strongly the reference affects output:

| Level | Effect | Best For |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Low (20-40%) | Subtle hints | Adding light style touches |
| Medium (40-60%) | Balanced blend | General use |
| High (60-80%) | Strong matching | Brand consistency |
| Maximum (80-100%) | Near replication | Exact style matching |

## Best Practices

### Choosing Good References

**Ideal reference videos:**
- Consistent style throughout
- Clear visual elements
- Good quality footage
- Representative of your desired aesthetic

**Avoid:**
- Videos with multiple conflicting styles
- Poor quality or heavily compressed
- Very fast or chaotic motion
- Overly complex compositions

### Building a Reference Library

Create a collection of reference videos for:
- Brand visual identity
- Different moods/seasons
- Various content types
- Specific platforms

## Credit Usage

Reference Video uses slightly more credits due to additional processing:

| Duration | Credits |
|----------|---------|
| 3-5 seconds | 8 credits |
| 6-15 seconds | 15 credits |
| 16-30 seconds | 25 credits |

## Use Cases

### Brand Consistency
Maintain the same visual style across all marketing videos, ensuring brand recognition.

### Series Creation
Create episodic content with consistent aesthetics using one video as the style master.

### Style Replication
Capture and apply a specific visual style to new content without manually recreating it.

### Content Expansion
Generate more content that matches existing successful videos.

## Combining with Art Styles

You can apply GenX art styles on top of reference video characteristics for layered effects:

1. Reference captures motion and composition
2. Art style adds artistic transformation
3. Result combines both influences
