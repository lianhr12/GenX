## Create from Imagination

Text to Video lets you generate artistic videos purely from text descriptions. No images needed—just describe your vision and let AI bring it to life.

## How It Works

1. **Write a Prompt** - Describe what you want to see
2. **Choose Style** - Select an artistic style
3. **Configure Settings** - Set duration and motion
4. **Generate** - AI creates your vision
5. **Download** - Get your video

## Writing Effective Prompts

The key to great results is writing clear, descriptive prompts.

### Prompt Structure

A good prompt includes:

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Subject | "A lone wolf" |
| Action | "standing on a cliff" |
| Environment | "overlooking a misty valley" |
| Atmosphere | "at dawn, golden light" |

### Complete Example

> "A lone wolf standing on a cliff overlooking a misty valley at dawn, golden light illuminating its fur, majestic and peaceful atmosphere"

## Prompt Tips

### Do:
- Be specific about visual elements
- Describe colors and lighting
- Include mood and atmosphere
- Mention movement when relevant

### Don't:
- Use abstract concepts that can't be visualized
- Write overly long, complex prompts
- Include contradictory descriptions
- Expect exact literal interpretation
