## How Credits Work

GenX uses a credit system to provide flexible, pay-as-you-go video generation. Credits are consumed each time you generate a video.

## Credit Usage

### Standard Generation (Image to Video, Text to Video)

| Video Duration | Credits Used |
|---------------|--------------|
| 3-5 seconds | 5 credits |
| 6-15 seconds | 10 credits |
| 16-30 seconds | 20 credits |

### Reference Video

Reference Video requires additional processing, so it uses more credits:

| Video Duration | Credits Used |
|---------------|--------------|
| 3-5 seconds | 8 credits |
| 6-15 seconds | 15 credits |
| 16-30 seconds | 25 credits |

## Credit Tips

### Maximize Your Credits

1. **Test with short videos first** - Use 3-5 second videos to test prompts and settings before committing to longer durations.

2. **Refine prompts before generating** - Take time to craft your prompts carefully to avoid wasted generations.

3. **Use reference videos for consistency** - While they cost more per video, reference videos can save credits by reducing the need for multiple attempts.

4. **Choose the right duration** - Don't default to maximum length if a shorter video will suffice.

### When Credits Are Consumed

Credits are only consumed when:
- Generation completes successfully
- You download or save the video

Credits are NOT consumed when:
- Generation fails (credits are refunded)
- You're previewing settings
- You're uploading content
