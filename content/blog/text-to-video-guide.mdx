## Create Videos from Your Imagination

Text to Video is one of GenX's most powerful features, allowing you to generate artistic videos purely from written descriptions. No images needed—just your imagination and words.

## How Text to Video Works

GenX's AI analyzes your text prompt to understand:
- The scene you're describing
- The mood and atmosphere
- Key visual elements
- Movement and action

Then it generates a unique video that brings your description to life in your chosen artistic style.

## Writing Effective Prompts

The key to great text-to-video results is writing clear, descriptive prompts. Here's how to craft the perfect prompt:

### Basic Prompt Structure

A good prompt typically includes:

1. **Subject** - What is the main focus?
2. **Action** - What is happening?
3. **Environment** - Where is this taking place?
4. **Mood/Style** - What feeling should it evoke?

### Example Prompts

**Simple:**
> A butterfly landing on a flower

**Detailed:**
> A vibrant monarch butterfly gently landing on a purple lavender flower in a sunlit meadow, with soft morning light filtering through

**Atmospheric:**
> A lone figure walking through a rain-soaked city street at night, neon signs reflecting on wet pavement, mysterious and cinematic mood

### Prompt Writing Tips

**Do:**
- Be specific about colors, lighting, and atmosphere
- Describe movement and action
- Include emotional or mood descriptors
- Mention time of day or weather if relevant

**Avoid:**
- Vague or abstract concepts
- Too many subjects competing for attention
- Contradictory descriptions
- Extremely long, complex prompts

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to Text to Video

Go to [Create → Text to Video](/create/video) from your dashboard.

### Step 2: Write Your Prompt

Enter your description in the text field. Remember:
- Be descriptive but clear
- Focus on visual elements
- Consider the style you'll choose

### Step 3: Select Your Art Style

Choose from:
- **Cyberpunk** - Best for futuristic, tech-themed prompts
- **Watercolor** - Perfect for nature, soft scenes
- **Oil Painting** - Great for dramatic, artistic scenes
- **Anime** - Ideal for character-focused content
- **Fluid Art** - Best for abstract, flowing concepts

### Step 4: Configure Settings

**Duration:** 3-30 seconds
**Motion:** Adjust intensity based on your prompt

### Step 5: Generate and Review

Click generate and wait for your video. Review and regenerate with adjusted prompts if needed.

## Prompt Templates

### Urban Scenes
```
[Subject] in [city/urban setting], [time], [mood], [weather]
```
Example: "A busy intersection in Tokyo at night, rain falling, neon lights reflecting everywhere, bustling energy"

### Abstract Concepts
```
[Colors/shapes] [movement], [emotion], [texture]
```
Example: "Swirling blues and purples, cosmic energy, peaceful and meditative, silk-like texture"

```
[Character description] [action], [setting], [mood/emotion]
```
Example: "A young artist painting at an easel, sunlit studio filled with canvases, focused and inspired"

## Style + Prompt Combinations

| Prompt Type | Best Styles |
|------------|-------------|
| Futuristic cities | Cyberpunk |
| Nature, landscapes | Watercolor, Oil Painting |
| Characters, people | Anime, Oil Painting |
| Abstract concepts | Fluid Art, Watercolor |
| Action scenes | Anime, Cyberpunk |

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Elements
Layer multiple visual elements for richer scenes:
> "Cherry blossoms falling around a traditional Japanese temple, koi fish visible in a pond below, soft pink and orange sunset sky"

### Emotional Direction
Add emotional guidance to influence the output:
> "A cozy cabin in the snow, warm light glowing from windows, peaceful and inviting, Christmas atmosphere"

### Camera Movement Hints
Suggest perspectives:
> "Aerial view of a winding river through autumn forest, slowly revealing a hidden waterfall"

## Troubleshooting

**Output doesn't match prompt:**
- Simplify your description
- Focus on 2-3 key elements
- Be more specific about visual details

**Video looks generic:**
- Add unique details
- Specify colors and lighting
- Include mood descriptors

**Motion doesn't feel right:**
- Describe the type of movement explicitly
- Adjust motion intensity settings
- Try shorter durations first
