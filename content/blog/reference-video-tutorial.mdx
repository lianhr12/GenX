## Create with Style Consistency

The Reference Video feature allows you to use an existing video as a guide for generating new content. This powerful tool helps maintain consistent aesthetics across your projects.

## What is Reference Video?

Reference Video works by analyzing a source video to understand:
- Visual style and color palette
- Movement patterns and pacing
- Composition and framing
- Overall aesthetic feel

GenX then applies these characteristics to generate new videos that share the same visual DNA.

## Use Cases

### Brand Consistency

Maintain a unified look across all your video content. Create one video with your desired style, then use it as a reference for future videos.

### Style Transfer

Love the look of a particular video? Use it as a reference to create new content with that same aesthetic.

### Motion Matching

Need your new video to have similar movement patterns? Reference Video can capture and replicate motion styles.

### Series Creation

Creating a video series? Use the first video as a reference to ensure visual consistency throughout.

## How to Use Reference Video

### Step 1: Prepare Your Reference

Choose a video that represents the style you want:
- Clear, high-quality video
- Representative of your desired aesthetic
- Good examples of the motion style you want

**Supported formats:** MP4, MOV, WebM
**Maximum file size:** 100MB
**Optimal length:** 5-30 seconds

### Step 2: Upload Reference Video

Navigate to [Create → Reference Video](/create/reference-to-video) and upload your reference video.

### Step 3: Provide Source Content

Choose your input method:
- **Image + Reference:** Upload images to be transformed with the reference style
- **Text + Reference:** Describe new content to be generated with the reference style

### Step 4: Adjust Settings

**Style Influence:** Control how strongly the reference affects the output
- Low: Subtle influence
- Medium: Balanced blend
- High: Strong adherence to reference

**Motion Transfer:** Choose how movement is applied
- Match timing: Follow the reference video's pacing
- Free motion: Natural movement based on content

### Step 5: Generate

Click generate and let the AI create your new video with the reference style applied.

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Reference

**Good references have:**
- Consistent style throughout
- Clear visual elements
- Distinct color palettes
- Recognizable motion patterns

**Avoid references with:**
- Multiple conflicting styles
- Poor video quality
- Very fast or chaotic motion
- Heavily compressed footage

### Matching Reference to Content

| Content Type | Best Reference Style |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Product videos | Clean, professional videos |

### Style Influence Guidelines

| Influence Level | Best For |
|----------------|----------|
| Low (20-40%) | Adding subtle style hints |
| Medium (40-60%) | Balanced style transfer |
| High (60-80%) | Strong style matching |
| Maximum (80-100%) | Near-exact replication |

## Advanced Techniques

### Creating a Style Library

### Combining References

For complex projects:
