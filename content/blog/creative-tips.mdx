## Unlock Your Creative Potential

Creating stunning videos with GenX is an art that combines technical knowledge with creative vision. This guide shares expert tips and best practices gathered from thousands of successful creations.

## Foundation: Quality In, Quality Out

### Image Quality Guidelines

The quality of your input directly affects your output. Here's what to aim for:

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| Resolution | 1080p or higher |
| Format | PNG (best) or high-quality JPEG |
| File size | Under 10MB, but not over-compressed |
| Lighting | Well-lit, avoid extreme shadows |
| Sharpness | Clear and focused |

### Text Prompt Fundamentals

For text-to-video, your words are your input. Make them count:

1. **Be Visual** - Describe what you want to *see*, not abstract concepts
2. **Layer Details** - Add specific colors, textures, and lighting
3. **Set the Scene** - Include environment and atmosphere
4. **Guide Motion** - Describe movement when relevant

## Style Selection Mastery

### When to Use Each Style

**Cyberpunk**
- Tech products and software
- Gaming content
- Music videos
- Night scenes
- Futuristic themes

**Watercolor**
- Nature content
- Romantic themes
- Soft, emotional pieces
- Children's content
- Meditative visuals

**Oil Painting**
- Portraits and people
- Dramatic scenes
- Premium brand content
- Historical themes
- Artistic showcases

**Fluid Art**

## Advanced Techniques

### The 3-Layer Approach

Build your prompts in layers for richer results:

**Layer 1: Subject**
> "A majestic lion"

**Layer 2: Add Context**
> "A majestic lion standing on a rocky outcrop"

**Layer 3: Add Atmosphere**
> "A majestic lion standing on a rocky outcrop at golden hour, dramatic clouds in the background, warm light illuminating its mane"

### Color Psychology

Use color deliberately to evoke emotions:

| Color | Emotion | Best For |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Blue | Trust, calm | Corporate, wellness |
| Red | Energy, passion | Action, food |
| Green | Growth, nature | Eco, health |
| Purple | Luxury, creativity | Premium, art |
| Orange | Warmth, fun | Youth, casual |
| Gold | Premium, success | Luxury, achievement |

### Motion Intensity

Match motion intensity to your content:

- **Subtle (Low):** Portraits, products, calm scenes
- **Moderate (Medium):** General content, most use cases
- **Dynamic (High):** Action, music, energetic content

## Workflow Optimization

### The Iteration Method

Don't expect perfection on the first try:

1. **Generate Draft** - Quick attempt with basic settings
2. **Evaluate** - What works? What doesn't?
3. **Refine** - Adjust prompts or settings
4. **Regenerate** - Create improved version
5. **Perfect** - Fine-tune final details

### Batch Processing Strategy

For multiple videos:

1. Start with one to establish the style
2. Document successful settings
3. Apply to remaining content
4. Maintain consistency across the batch

### Credit Efficiency

Maximize your credits:

- Start with shorter durations to test
- Refine prompts before long generations
- Use reference videos for consistency
- Save successful prompts for reuse

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Over-complicated Prompts

**Bad:** "A beautiful serene peaceful calm tranquil landscape with mountains and rivers and trees and birds and flowers and sunset and clouds..."

**Good:** "A serene mountain landscape at sunset, with a river reflecting orange and pink sky"

### ❌ Conflicting Descriptions

**Bad:** "A dark, brightly-lit room with warm cool tones"

**Good:** "A dimly-lit room with warm amber accents"

### ❌ Wrong Style for Content

**Bad:** Cyberpunk style for a wedding video

**Good:** Watercolor or Oil Painting for romantic content

### ❌ Ignoring Aspect Ratios

Always consider where your video will be used:
- **16:9** - YouTube, presentations
- **9:16** - TikTok, Instagram Reels, Shorts
- **1:1** - Instagram feed, social posts
