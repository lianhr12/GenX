Hey r/SideProject!

After months of development, I'm excited to share GenX.art.

**What it does:**
Upload any photo → Choose from 5 art styles → Get an HD art video in ~30 seconds

**The styles:**
- Cyberpunk (neon lights, digital rain)
- Watercolor (soft, dreamy effects)
- Oil Painting (classic, warm tones)
- Anime (Japanese animation style)
- Fluid Art (abstract, mesmerizing)

**Why I built it:**
I wanted to create artistic videos but couldn't justify spending months learning After Effects. Existing AI tools either looked generic or cost a fortune.

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 15
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Stripe for payments
- Multiple AI providers for generation

**Pricing:**
- Free: 15 credits on signup
- Pro: $9.90/month for 800 credits

### Maker Comment
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I built GenX because I was frustrated with the gap between having creative ideas and actually making them happen.

Learning After Effects? Months.
Hiring an editor? Thousands of dollars.
Using templates? Looks like everyone else.

GenX solves this with AI-powered style transfer that actually looks artistic, not just filtered.

A few things I'm proud of:
- Each style is carefully tuned (not just generic presets)
- 30-second generation (cloud-optimized)
- Works entirely in browser

Would love to hear what styles you'd want to see next!

**标题**: Show HN: GenX.art – Turn photos into art videos in 30 seconds

```
Hi HN,

I built GenX.art, an AI tool that transforms static images into artistic videos.

Live demo: https://genx.art

The core idea: Upload a photo, select one of 5 art styles (Cyberpunk, Watercolor, Oil Painting, Anime, Fluid Art), and get an HD video in ~30 seconds.

Tech highlights:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Multiple AI providers for generation
- Stripe for payments
- S3 for storage

Why I built this: I wanted to create artistic video content but the learning curve for traditional tools (After Effects, Premiere) was too steep for occasional use. Existing AI tools either looked generic or were prohibitively expensive.

The differentiation is in the style-specific tuning. Each of the 5 styles has been carefully calibrated rather than using generic presets.

Free tier: 15 credits on signup (no credit card required)

Would appreciate any feedback on the output quality or UX. Happy to discuss the technical implementation.
